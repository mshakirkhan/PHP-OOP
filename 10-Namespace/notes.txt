Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:
1. They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
2. They allow the same name to be used for more than one class.

Example: you may have a set of classes which describe an HTML table, such as Table, Row and Cell while also having another 
set of classes to describe furniture, such as Table, Chair and Bed. Namespaces can be used to organize the classes into two different 
groups while also preventing the two classes Table and Table from being mixed up.

Use Keyword: If we use "use my\pdo\Pdo" we are able to make object with class name, don't need to give namespace in object.
